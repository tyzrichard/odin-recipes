        <p5>Serve this traditional meal in hot broth for a delicious and warming meal.</p1>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups water</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place flour in a large bowl and gradually mix in water. Mix until dough comes together; knead until smooth, 15 to 20 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Knead dough again for 2 minutes; cover and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Knead dough one more time for 2 minutes. Divide into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 3/8-inch-thick sheet. Brush both sides of each sheet with oil. Stack sheet together; cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fill a large saucepan with water and bring to boil.</li>
            <li>Place one sheet of dough on a cutting board and slice into 1/8-inch-wide strips. Take one end of a strip in each hand and stretch it until it is 30 to 35-inches long. Fold it in thirds and stretch again to the same length; shake and slap against the counter several times to lengthen it to 2 to 3 yards. Drop it into boiling water. Add 2 to 3 more strips of noodles to boiling water; cook until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer drained noodles to a serving bowl.</li>
            <li>Repeat with remaining sheets of dough.</li>
        </ol>
